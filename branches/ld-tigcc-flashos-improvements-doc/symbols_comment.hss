Title=_comment

[Top]
Usually, this symbol is not handled in a special way. However, if it does
not exist at all, it is redirected to the entry point of the program. The
effect is that constructs of the form
<PRE>.word _comment-<I>entry_point</I>
</PRE>
resolve to 0 if the symbol is undefined.

The kernel headers reference this symbol as the comment string of the
program. If it exists, it must be a zero-terminated ASCII string.
