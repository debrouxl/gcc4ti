[Top]
To add an existing file, click on 'Project/Add Files...' and select the files you want to add.  These can be C or Assembly source files, header files, or object files.  Generally you can include any file that belongs to your project, even text files, in order to edit them and to keep them together.  Source files always have to be added to the project in order to be found.
