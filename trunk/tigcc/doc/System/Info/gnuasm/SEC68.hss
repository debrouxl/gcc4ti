Title=.abort

[Top]
This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for
compatibility with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the
assembly language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the sender
of the source quit, it could use this directive to tell <CODE>as</CODE> to
quit also.  One day <CODE>.abort</CODE> will not be supported.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>.ABORT</CODE> is accepted as an alternate spelling of <CODE>.abort</CODE>.
