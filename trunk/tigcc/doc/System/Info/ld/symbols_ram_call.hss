The symbol _RAM_CALL_<I>index</I> is resolved to the RAM call with the index
<I>index</I>, interpreted as a hexadecimal value. If RAM calls are supported,
the operating system translates references to such symbols in a way that they
either point to a specific location in memory, or are replaced by a specific
value.
