Title=Compare/Test Instruction Optimization

[Top]
If this type of optimization is turned on, then the GCC4TI linker optimizes
all instructions that compare the contents of a memory location with
something. This includes operations that compare data and operations that
test whether something is zero.
<BR><BR>
This optimization can reduce the number of absolute references to locations
inside the program, and it can also decrease the size of the code if
range-cutting is enabled.
