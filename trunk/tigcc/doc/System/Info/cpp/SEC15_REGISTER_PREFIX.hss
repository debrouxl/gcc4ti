Title=__REGISTER_PREFIX__

[Top]
This macro expands to a single token (not a string constant) which is
the prefix applied to CPU register names in assembly language for this
target.  You can use it to write assembly that is usable in multiple
environments.  For example, in the <CODE>m68k-aout</CODE> environment it
expands to nothing, but in the <CODE>m68k-coff</CODE> environment (as TIGCC is) it expands
to a single <CODE>%</CODE>.
