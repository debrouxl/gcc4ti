Title=Mixed Declarations and Code

[Top]
ISO C99 and ISO C++ allow declarations and code to be freely mixed
within compound statements.  As an extension, GCC also allows this in
C89 mode.  For example, you could do:
<PRE>int i;
/* ... */
i++;
int j = i + 2;
</PRE>
Each identifier is visible from where it is declared until the end of
the enclosing block.
