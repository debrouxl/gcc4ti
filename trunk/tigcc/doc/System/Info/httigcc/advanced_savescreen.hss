Title=SAVE_SCREEN

[Top]
If you put
<PRE>#define SAVE_SCREEN
</PRE>
at the beginning of your program, the screen will be saved automatically at
startup and restored when the program terminates. This takes
<A HREF="$$LINK(graph.h/LCD_SIZE)">LCD_SIZE</A> bytes on the stack.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> Kernels always save the screen automatically, so this directive
has no effect in kernel mode.
