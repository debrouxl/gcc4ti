Title=COMMENT_PROGRAM_NAME

[Top]
To define a name for your program, write
<PRE>#define COMMENT_PROGRAM_NAME "<I>name</I>"
</PRE>
at the top of your source code. If supported by the target format, this will
store the text inside the quotes as a program name. The name can be longer
than eight characters, but it should not include any additional information
such as a version number or author name(s).
