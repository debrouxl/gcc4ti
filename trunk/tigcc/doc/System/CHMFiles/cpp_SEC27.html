<P>A <U>self-referential</U> macro is one whose name appears in its
definition.  Recall that all macro definitions are rescanned for more
macros to replace.  If the self-reference were considered a use of the
macro, it would produce an infinitely large expansion.  To prevent this,
the self-reference is not considered a macro call.  It is passed into
the preprocessor output unchanged.  Let's consider an example:
<PRE>#define foo (4 + foo)
</PRE>
where <CODE>foo</CODE> is also a variable in your program.
<BR><BR>
Following the ordinary rules, each reference to <CODE>foo</CODE> will expand
into <CODE>(4&nbsp;+&nbsp;foo)</CODE>; then this will be rescanned and will expand into
<CODE>(4&nbsp;+&nbsp;(4&nbsp;+&nbsp;foo))</CODE>; and so on until the computer runs out of memory.
<BR><BR>
The self-reference rule cuts this process short after one step, at
<CODE>(4&nbsp;+&nbsp;foo)</CODE>.  Therefore, this macro definition has the possibly
useful effect of causing the program to add 4 to the value of <CODE>foo</CODE>
wherever <CODE>foo</CODE> is referred to.
<BR><BR>
In most cases, it is a bad idea to take advantage of this feature.  A
person reading the program who sees that <CODE>foo</CODE> is a variable will
not expect that it is a macro as well.  The reader will come across the
identifier <CODE>foo</CODE> in the program and think its value should be that
of the variable <CODE>foo</CODE>, whereas in fact the value is four greater.
<BR><BR>
One common, useful use of self-reference is to create a macro which
expands to itself.  If you write
<PRE>#define EPERM EPERM
</PRE>
then the macro <CODE>EPERM</CODE> expands to <CODE>EPERM</CODE>.  Effectively, it is
left alone by the preprocessor whenever it's used in running text.  You
can tell that it's a macro with <CODE>#ifdef</CODE>.  You might do this if you
want to define numeric constants with an <CODE>enum</CODE>, but have
<CODE>#ifdef</CODE> be true for each constant.
<BR><BR>
If a macro <CODE>x</CODE> expands to use a macro <CODE>y</CODE>, and the expansion of
<CODE>y</CODE> refers to the macro <CODE>x</CODE>, that is an <U>indirect
self-reference</U> of <CODE>x</CODE>.  <CODE>x</CODE> is not expanded in this case
either.  Thus, if we have
<PRE>#define x (4 + y)
#define y (2 * x)
</PRE>
then <CODE>x</CODE> and <CODE>y</CODE> expand as follows:
<PRE>x    expands to (4 + y)
     expands to (4 + (2 * x))

y    expands to (2 * x)
     expands to (2 * (4 + y))
</PRE>
Each macro is expanded when it appears in the definition of the other
macro, but not when it indirectly appears in its own definition.
