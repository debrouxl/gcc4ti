<P>A <U>string</U> is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to <U>escape</U> these characters: precede them with
a backslash <CODE>\</CODE> character.  For example <CODE>\\</CODE> represents
one backslash:  the first <CODE>\</CODE> is an escape which tells
<CODE>as</CODE> to interpret the second character literally as a backslash
(which prevents <CODE>as</CODE> from recognizing the second <CODE>\</CODE> as an
escape character).  The complete list of escapes follows.
<DL>
<DT><B>\b</B>
<DD>Mnemonic for backspace; for ASCII this is octal code 010.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>\f</B>
<DD>Mnemonic for FormFeed; for ASCII this is octal code 014.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>\n</B>
<DD>Mnemonic for newline; for ASCII this is octal code 012.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>\r</B>
<DD>Mnemonic for carriage-Return; for ASCII this is octal code 015.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>\t</B>
<DD>Mnemonic for horizontal Tab; for ASCII this is octal code 011.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>\ <I>digit</I> <I>digit</I> <I>digit</I></B>
<DD>An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.
For compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as digits:
for example, <CODE>\008</CODE> has the value 010, and <CODE>\009</CODE> the value 011.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>\x <I>hex-digits...</I></B>
<DD>A hex character code.  All trailing hex digits are combined.  Either upper or
lower case <CODE>x</CODE> works.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>\\</B>
<DD>Represents one <CODE>\</CODE> character.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>\&quot;</B>
<DD>Represents one <CODE>&quot;</CODE> character.  Needed in strings to represent
this character, because an unescaped <CODE>&quot;</CODE> would end the string.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>\ <I>anything-else</I></B>
<DD>Any other character when escaped by <CODE>\</CODE> gives a warning, but
assembles as if the <CODE>\</CODE> was not present.  The idea is that if
you used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
interpretation of the following character.  However <CODE>as</CODE> has no
other interpretation, so <CODE>as</CODE> knows it is giving you the wrong
code and warns you of the fact.
</DL>
Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think
the BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C
compilers recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape
sequence.
