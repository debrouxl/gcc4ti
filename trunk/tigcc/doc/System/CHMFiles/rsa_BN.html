TIOS uses big integers for implementing RSA criptography algorithm to authenticate
(digitally sign) ROM images (and flash applications), more precise, to protect actual
ROM/Flash certificate data (see <A HREF="cert.html">cert.h</A> header file).
The basic ideas of RSA are as follows: under certain conditions, function
<BR><BR>
Y&nbsp;=&nbsp;(X&nbsp;^&nbsp;A)&nbsp;<B>mod</B>&nbsp;N
<BR><BR>
has function
<BR><BR>
X&nbsp;=&nbsp;(Y&nbsp;^&nbsp;B)&nbsp;<B>mod</B>&nbsp;N
<BR><BR>
as its inverse function, where parameter B depends, of course, of A and N.
But, computing B from A and N requires that the prime factors of N are known.
Now, suppose that N&nbsp;=&nbsp;P&nbsp;*&nbsp;Q, where P and Q are large primes,
such that nobody can factor N in a real time. Suppose also that somebody
(person <B>XXX</B> for example) knows two large primes P and Q. Person <B>XXX</B> can compute
N&nbsp;=&nbsp;P&nbsp;*&nbsp;Q. After this, he may insist (for security reasons) that
anybody which wants to send the message to <B>XXX</B> must to encode the message using
the formula Y&nbsp;=&nbsp;(X^A)&nbsp;<B>mod</B>&nbsp;N,
where X is an original message, and Y is encoded message. Constants A and N
may be published without any danger, and pair (N,A) is so-called public key.
<B>XXX</B> may decrypt encoded message Y using the formula
X&nbsp;=&nbsp;(Y^B)&nbsp;<B>mod</B>&nbsp;N
because <B>XXX</B> can calculate B (he knows the prime factor of N). But
note that nobody else can decrypt X, because nobody else knows prime factors of N a priori,
and they cannot be computed in a real time. Pair (N,B) is so-called private key.
<BR><BR>
This is only a half of the story. Suppose that person <B>XXX</B> wants to send a
message to person <B>YYY</B>. He will encrypt the message with the public key of
person <B>YYY</B>. <B>YYY</B> will, of course, decrypt the message with his private key.
But, suppose that <B>XXX</B> send together with encoded message another message
(called "signature") which is encoded using formula
Y&nbsp;=&nbsp;(X^B)&nbsp;<B>mod</B>&nbsp;N, i.e.
using PRIVATE key of <B>XXX</B>. Then, if <B>YYY</B> tries to decode such message using
PUBLIC key of <B>XXX</B>, he must get original message too (so, he will receive
two identical copies of the message). But, after this, <B>YYY</B> can be sure
that really <B>XXX</B> sent the message (not some third person), because nobody else
can compute B from A, i.e. nobody else can produce a message which can be
decrypted using the public key of <B>XXX</B>!
<BR><BR>
To summarize: the RSA algorithm uses two keys, one is public and one private.
Data encrypted with one of these keys can only be decrypted with the other key.
So given the procedure is secure, data encryped with the public key can only be
decrypted with the private key, and valid data decrypted with the public key
could only be produced by the private key.
