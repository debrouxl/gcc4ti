<P>EM_write is mostly identical as <A HREF="flash_FL_write.html">FL_write</A>, except an error will be
thrown if <I>dest</I> points out of the archive memory (i.e. user portion of the Flash ROM).
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> For anybody who wants to write something into the archive memory, the following
information may be useful:
<UL>
<LI>Blocks in the archive memory are kept in the linked list, but the organization of the
list is AMS-dependent (see <A HREF="compat.html">compat.h</A> header file to see how to
check which AMS version is present on the machine). If you don't want problems, you should
not write any data to the archive memory which are not organized as described below.
<LI>Archive memory is divided in sectors which are 64K long. The first word of each sector
is the status word, and it cannot be used for storage purposes
(-2 means "sector in use", -4
means "full sector", and -1 means "unused sector").
Each block must completely
belong to one sector, i.e. it cannot cross over sector boundaries.
<LI>Before each block is a header. It starts with a flag which may be -4
for deleted blocks, -2 for used blocks and -1 for free blocks (AMS 2.xx uses
-32 and -64 instead of -2 and -4, I don't know why; maybe old flags may be used
for "noname" files, see below).
So, if you need to keep some data in the archive memory for a longer time, it must be
marked with -2 (or -32 on AMS 2.xx), otherwise it may be treated by TIOS as "free space".
<LI>After the flag word, on AMS 2.xx the name of the folder (8 bytes) and the name of the
stored file (8 bytes) are stored (both of them are zero padded). After this, yet one word
follows (usually set to zero), exact meaning is unknown to me. This extra information
(18 bytes) is not present on AMS 1.xx.
<LI>After this, the next stored word is the size of the block in words increased
by 1 and with the topmost bit set. This word is used as a link to the next block. This concludes
the block header. Its size is 4 bytes on AMS 1.xx and 22 bytes on AMS 2.xx.
<LI>Finally, the actual content of the block follows. If a handle is associated with the
block, the handle points just here, i.e. to the first byte of the actual content.
</UL>
Function <A HREF="flash_EM_findEmptySlot.html">EM_findEmptySlot</A> may be used for finding an
empty space in the archive memory of a given size.
Of course, if you are not an experienced programmer, avoid direct writing in the archive
memory. Use safe high-level functions like
<A HREF="vat_EM_moveSymToExtMem.html">EM_moveSymToExtMem</A> instead.
