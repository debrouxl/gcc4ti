<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>Registers an event (vectored) timer.</B>
<P>Before release 2.04 of the AMS, TIOS also had two event (vectored) timers numbered as 1 and 2
(in addition to 6 notify timers which may be registered using
<A HREF="system_OSRegisterTimer.html">OSRegisterTimer</A>). In AMS 2.04, Texas Instruments decided
for some strange reasons to remove these vectored timers from the TIOS. I was very angry due to
this decision, so I decided to reimplement these timers independently of the TIOS, to
make them work on any AMS version. Well, now you have it. More precisely, you now have
two event (vectored) timers which are numbered as 1 and 2, which work on any AMS release
(TIOS based implementation as implemented in TIGCCLIB releases prior to 2.2 did not work
on AMS 2.04 and AMS 2.05).
<BR><BR>
OSVRegisterTimer initializes the event timer which ID number
is <I>timer_no</I>, and sets its initial value to <I>T</I>. Every time the
Auto-Int 5 is triggered (20 times per second if you didn't change the programable
rate generator), the current value of the timer is decremented by 1. When the
current value reaches zero, a procedure specified by user will be called, then
the timer starts counting again from its initial value. The parameter
<I>Action</I> is the pointer to the procedure which will be triggered every
time the timer reaches zero. So, the procedure <I>Action</I> will be called
periodically, with a period determined by <I>T</I>.
<BR><BR>
<I>Action</I> need not to be an assembly language procedure; it may be any
user-defined function written in C. Its body will be executed in the
supervisor CPU mode and with disabled interrupts (th information is probably
not important from the user point of view).
<BR><BR>
If the function <I>Action</I> changes any global variable
in the program, such global variable must be declared as "volatile" to inform
the compiler that its value may be changed asynchronously, i.e. in a way which
is unexpected for the normal program flow.
<BR><BR>
OSVRegisterTimer returns a nonzero value if the registration was successful, else
returns zero. This happens if you give wrong parameters, or if the timer <I>timer_no</I>
is already in use. So, you must first free the timer using
<A HREF="system_OSVFreeTimer.html">OSVFreeTimer</A> (as I completely rewrote these routines, I
also corrected some bugs in them which were presented in TIOS routines). As event
timers now work indepentently of TIOS timers, both event timers (1 and 2) are
free for use. Here is a simple example of a program which installs
both event timers (called "Timers"):
<PRE>// Install two timers with counter variables

#define USE_TI89              // Compile for TI-89
#define USE_TI92PLUS          // Compile for TI-92 Plus
#define USE_V200              // Compile for V200

#define MIN_AMS 100           // Compile for AMS 1.00 or higher
#define SAVE_SCREEN           // Save/Restore LCD Contents

#include &lt;tigcclib.h&gt;         // Include All Header Files

CALLBACK void Action1(void)
{
  static int Counter = 0;
  printf_xy (50, 50, &quot;Counter1 = %d  &quot;, ++Counter);
}

CALLBACK void Action2(void)
{
  static int Counter = 0;
  printf_xy (70, 70, &quot;Counter2 = %d  &quot;, ++Counter);
}

void _main(void)
{
  OSVRegisterTimer (1, 3, Action1);
  OSVRegisterTimer (2, 10, Action2);
  ngetchx ();
  OSVFreeTimer (1);
  OSVFreeTimer (2);
}
</PRE>
In this implementation of OSVRegisterTimer, it is not necessary to free timers using
<A HREF="system_OSVFreeTimer.html">OSVFreeTimer</A> before first usage of them, because they are
free by default at the beginning. However, nothing wrong will happen if you try to free
them explicitly (which was necessary in previous releases of TIGCCLIB).
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> As already mentioned above, all TIOS bugs in timer routines (dependence between
notify and event timers, etc.) are now removed, because these routines are rewritten to
be independent of the TIOS.
