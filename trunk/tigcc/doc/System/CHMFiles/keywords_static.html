<P CLASS="ITEMDESC">Preserves variable value to survive after its scope ends.
<P>Keyword <CODE>static</CODE> may be applied to both data and function definitions:
<PRE>static <I>data-definition</I>;
static <I>function-definition</I>;
</PRE>
For example,
<PRE>static int i = 10;
static void PrintCR (void) { putc ('\n'); }
</PRE>
<CODE>static</CODE> tells that a function or data element is only known within the scope of the current
compile. In addition, if you use the <CODE>static</CODE> keyword with a variable that is
local to a function, it allows the last value of the variable to be preserved between
successive calls to that function.
<BR><BR>
Note that the initialization of automatic and static variables is quite different. Automatic
variables (local variables are automatic by default, except you explicitely use <CODE>static</CODE>
keyword) are initialized during the run-time, so the initialization will be executed whenever
it is encountered in the program. Static (and global) variables are initialized during
the compile-time, so the initial values will simply be embeded in the executable
file itself. If you change them, they will retain changed in the file. By default, the C language
proposes that all uninitialized static variables are initialized to zero.
<BR><BR>
The fact that global and static variables are initialized in compile-time and kept in the
executable file itself has one serious consequence, which is not present on "standard" computers like PC, Mac, etc. Namely,
these computers always reload the executable on each start from an external memory device (disk),
but this is not the case on TI. So, if you have the following global (or static) variable
<PRE>int a = 10;
</PRE>
and if you change its value somewhere in the program to 20 (for example), its initial
value will be 20 (not 10) on the next program start! Note that this is true only for global
and static variables. To force reinitializing, you must put explicitely something
like
<PRE>a = 10;
</PRE>
at the begining of the main program!
<BR><BR>
Note, however, that if the program is archived,
the initial values will be restored each time you run the program, because archived
programs are reloaded from the archive memory to the RAM on each start, similarly
like the programs are reloaded from disks on "standard" computers each time when you start them.
