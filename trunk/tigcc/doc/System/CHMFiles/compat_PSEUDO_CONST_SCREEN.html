<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>A macro to construct a pseudo-constant from screen-based values.</B>
<P>PSEUDO_CONST_SCREEN takes several values for different types of screens, and
returns one of them based on the screen that the program currently uses.
The values must be plain positive integers up to 65535 (0xFFFF) in decimal
or hexadecimal notation, otherwise this macro may fail in some cases.
<BR><BR>
Currently, there are two types of screens: The TI-89 LCD with a size of
160x100 pixels, and the TI-92/TI-92+/V200 LCD with a size of 240x128 pixels.
The two parameters specify the values to use whichever screen type is
encountered, which means that the number of parameters may increase as new
hardware becomes available. If you want to use this macro in your
application, you must decide for yourself whether this feature is desirable:
On the one hand, it can prevent your code from being compiled in future
releases of GCC4TI; on the other hand, you can easily port your programs to
new hardware just by fixing all of the compile-time errors.
