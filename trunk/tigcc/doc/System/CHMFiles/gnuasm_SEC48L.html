<P>Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
They create symbols which are guaranteed to be unique over the entire scope of
the input source code and which can be referred to by a simple notation.
To define a local symbol, write a label of the form <CODE><I>N</I>:</CODE> (where <I>N</I>
represents any positive integer).  To refer to the most recent previous
definition of that symbol write <CODE><I>N</I>b</CODE>, using the same number as when
you defined the label.  To refer to the next definition of a local label, write
<CODE><I>N</I>f</CODE> - The <CODE>b</CODE> stands for &quot;backwards&quot; and the <CODE>f</CODE> stands
for &quot;forwards&quot;.
<BR><BR>
There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, and you can reuse them
as well.  So it is possible to repeatedly define the same local label (using
the same number <I>N</I>), although you can only refer to the most recently
defined local label of that number (for a backwards reference) or the next
definition of a specific local label for a forward reference.  It is also worth
noting that the first 10 local labels (<CODE>0:</CODE>...<CODE>9:</CODE>) are
implemented in a slightly more efficient manner than the others.
<BR><BR>
Here is an example:
<PRE>1:        jra 1f
2:        jra 1b
1:        jra 2f
2:        jra 1b
</PRE>
Which is the equivalent of:
<PRE>label_1:  jra label_3
label_2:  jra label_1
label_3:  jra label_4
label_4:  jra label_3
</PRE>
Local symbol names are only a notational device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler uses them.
The symbol names stored in the symbol table, appearing in error messages and
optionally emitted to the object file.  The names are constructed using these
parts:
<DL>
<DT><B>L</B>
<DD>All local labels begin with <CODE>L</CODE>.  Normally both <CODE>as</CODE> and
<CODE>ld</CODE> forget symbols that start with <CODE>L</CODE>.  These labels are
used for symbols you are never intended to see.  If you use the
<B>'-L'</B> option, <CODE>as</CODE> retains these symbols in the
object file.  If you also instruct <CODE>ld</CODE> to retain these symbols,
you may use them in debugging.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B><I>N</I></B>
<DD>This is the number that was used in the local label definition.  So if the
label is written <CODE>55:</CODE>, the number is <CODE>55</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B><CODE>\002</CODE></B>
<DD>This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally invent a symbol
of the same name.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B><I>ordinal number</I></B>
<DD>This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first definition of
<CODE>0:</CODE> gets the number <CODE>1</CODE>.  The 15th definition of <CODE>0:</CODE> gets the
number <CODE>15</CODE>, and so on.  Likewise the first definition of <CODE>1:</CODE> gets
the number <CODE>1</CODE> and its 15th defintion gets <CODE>15</CODE> as well.
