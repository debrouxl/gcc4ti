I need variable-size arrays, i.e. arrays which size is not known in compile time...
</TD></TR><TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><B>A:</B></TD><TD>
In general, making variable-size arrays in C is extremely easy for
one-dimensional arrays. Instead of
<PRE>int a[n];  // <I>where n is not known in compile-time</I></PRE>
you can write:
<PRE>int *a;
...
a = calloc (n, sizeof (int));
</PRE>
The same is not-so-easy for 2-dimensional arrays (see the previous question), and quite hard
(although possible) for n-dimensional arrays where n&gt;2. To do this, you need to have nasty
plays with pointers. It is even possible to make a function named <CODE>multi_dim</CODE> which
creates  multidimensional variable-sized arrays. I once created such routine for some
internal purposes (note that it is very tricky). Principally, its usage is like this:
if you want to simulate
<PRE>int a[n1][n2][n3][n4];</PRE>
where n1, n2, n3 and n4 are not known apriori, you need to do:
<PRE>int ****a;  // <I>yes, quadruple pointer!!!</I>
...
a = multi_dim (4, sizeof (int), n1, n2, n3, n4);
</PRE>
However, GCC4TI is GNU C, and it has some <A HREF="gnuexts.html">extensions</A> in addition to
"standard" C. For example, it allows variable-size arrays without any tricky
plays with pointers!!! (Note that this particular extension, together with a few others,
has been added to standard ISO C in 1999, so it is no longer non-standard.) Try this:
<PRE>void _main(void)
{
  int m, n, p;
  m = random (5);
  n = random (5);
  p = random (5);
  {
    int a[m][n][p];
    // <I>do something with a</I>
  }
}
</PRE>
and you will see that it works!
