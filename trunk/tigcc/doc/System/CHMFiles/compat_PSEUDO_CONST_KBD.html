<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>A macro to construct a pseudo-constant from keyboard-based values.</B>
<P>PSEUDO_CONST_KBD takes several values for different keyboard layouts, and
returns one of them based on the keyboard that the program currently uses.
The values must be plain positive integers up to 65535 (0xFFFF) in decimal
or hexadecimal notation, otherwise this macro may fail in some cases.
<BR><BR>
Currently, there are two different keyboard layouts: The TI-89 keyboard,
which looks like a normal calculator keyboard with extra keys, and the
TI-92/TI-92+/V200 keyboard, which has a QWERTY layout.
The two parameters specify the values to use whichever keyboard layout is
encountered, which means that the number of parameters may increase as new
hardware becomes available. If you want to use this macro in your
application, you must decide for yourself whether this feature is desirable:
On the one hand, it can prevent your code from being compiled in future
releases of GCC4TI; on the other hand, you can easily port your programs to
new hardware just by fixing all of the compile-time errors.
