<P>Quotes are used for defining string constants. In the compile-time, the sequence of characters
between qoutes are stored somewhere in the executable file. In the run time, the "result" of
quotes is a pointer (of type <CODE>'char*'</CODE>) which points to the place where the sequence
of characters is stored. This interpretation of quotes differs significantly from the interpretation
of strings in other languages. That's why there is nothing wrong with the following C code (it
stores the address where the text "Hello" is stored, interpreted as an integer, in <CODE>a</CODE>):
<PRE>int a;
a = (int)"Hello";
</PRE>
Such constructs are usually impossible in other languages. Note that sequences of characters
between quotes behave similarly like arrays declared with the <A HREF="keywords_static.html">static</A>
keyword, i.e. they can survive the end of a function or program if they are changed somewhere in
the program (anyway, it is very bad idea to change the content of a string constant). For example,
the following code
<PRE>for (i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++)
  {
    char *str;
    str = "xyz";
    printf (str);
    *str = 'a';
  }
</PRE>
will display "xyzayz", although it seems that "xyzxyz" would be displayed. Such strange behaviour
is caused by the fact that "xyz" is initialized in the compile-time. Now, if you understand the
correct interpretation of what the quote punctuator does, you can explain this behaviour easily.
To learn: strings in C behave quite differently than in most other languages!
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> These two statements are <B>very</B> different, although most books say
that they are nearly the same:
<PRE>char str[] = "Hello";
char *str = "Hello";
</PRE>
Suppose that <I>str</I> is declared in the body of the function (i.e. it is an automatic
local variable). In both cases, the text "Hello" is stored somewhere in memory, and the "result"
of <CODE>"Hello"</CODE> is the address where it is stored (we will call this address <I>addr</I>).
In the first case, <I>str</I> is a local array (i.e. it is created on the stack at run
time, and there will be 6 bytes reserved for it), whose content is initialized at run-time
(because it does not exist at compile-time) with the sequence of bytes located at <I>addr</I>.
In other words, it is the same as you wrote:
<PRE>char str[6];
strcpy (str, "Hello");
</PRE>
The consequence is that if you change
the content of <I>str</I> (note that this is not the same as changing bytes pointed to
by <I>addr</I>), it will be reinitialized each time when this statement is encountered
again. But, in the second case, <I>str</I> is a local pointer, whose content is
initialized (at run-time) with <I>addr</I>! So, if the contents of the string "Hello" are
changed, this change will be permanent, because when this statement is encountered again,
<I>str</I> will simply be reinitialized (if changed) to <I>addr</I> but bytes
pointed to by it are not restored! Confused? See the following code:
<PRE>for (i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++)
  {
    char str[] = "Hello";
    printf (str);
    str[0] = 'a';
  }
</PRE>
This program will work as expected (it will display "Hello" twice). But, if you change
<CODE>'str[]'</CODE> to <CODE>'*str'</CODE>, it will not work as expected (it will
display "Hello" and then "aello").

Generally, it is a very bad idea to change strings which are the result of quotes.
The reason is that usually equal strings are stored only once in the program.
This means that you can get unexpected results if you modify them.

If the '\' character is found inside a string literal, it is threated as the start
of an escape code. Here is an incomplete list of possible escape codes:
