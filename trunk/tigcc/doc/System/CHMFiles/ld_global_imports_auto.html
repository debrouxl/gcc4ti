<P>In addition to user-defined global imports, the GCC4TI linker also defines
some global imports of its own, whenever special code is needed to handle a
situation:
<BR><BR>
<DL>
<DT><B>__kernel_program_header</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the linker
    is operating in <A HREF="ld_modes_kernel.html">kernel mode</A>, and if the
    file is not declared as a library (see the
    <A HREF="ld_control_library.html">_library</A> control symbol).
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__kernel_library_header</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the linker
    is operating in <A HREF="ld_modes_kernel.html">kernel mode</A>, and if the
    file is declared as a library (see the
    <A HREF="ld_control_library.html">_library</A> control symbol).
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__fargo_program_header</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the linker
    is operating in <A HREF="ld_modes_fargo.html">Fargo II mode</A>, and if the
    file is not declared as a library (see the
    <A HREF="ld_control_library.html">_library</A> control symbol).
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__fargo_library_header</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the linker
    is operating in <A HREF="ld_modes_fargo.html">Fargo II mode</A>, and if the
    file is declared as a library (see the
    <A HREF="ld_control_library.html">_library</A> control symbol).
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__flash_os_header</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the linker
    is operating in <A HREF="ld_modes_flash_os.html">Flash OS mode</A>.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__nostub_comment_header</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if NoStub data (comment) exports
    are defined for the program. The file reacting to this import must use
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_nostub_comment_count.html">__ld_nostub_comment_count
    </A> and
    <A HREF="ld_insert_nostub_comments.html">__ld_insert_nostub_comments</A>
    to insert the actual data exports into the header.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__handle_constructors</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if constructors
    are defined for the program. The file which handles this import must query
    the constructor section using the
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_constructors_start.html">__ld_constructors_start</A>,
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_constructors_end.html">__ld_constructors_end</A>,
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_constructors_size.html">__ld_constructors_size</A>,
    and <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_constructor_count.html">__ld_constructor_count</A>
    symbols.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__handle_destructors</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if destructors
    are defined for the program. The file which handles this import must query
    the destructor section using the
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_destructors_start.html">__ld_destructors_start</A>,
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_destructors_end.html">__ld_destructors_end</A>,
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_destructors_size.html">__ld_destructors_size</A>,
    and <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_destructor_count.html">__ld_destructor_count</A>
    symbols.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__handle_bss</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the program
    contains a BSS section (a section containing uninitialized global variables).
    No file needs to react to this import; if the BSS section is not created at
    run time (using <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_bss_size.html">__ld_bss_size</A>,
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_bss_ref_count.html">__ld_bss_ref_count</A>, and
    an appropriate <A HREF="ld_insert.html">insertion</A> for the relocation), it
    is simply passed on to the output file. If the output format does not support
    sections, the BSS section is merged with the other sections. However, if the
    program reacts to this import, it absolutely <I>must</I> handle the
    relocation entries pointing into the BSS section.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__initialize_bss</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the program
    contains a BSS section, and the program requires the contents of this section
    to be initialized to zero. The file reacting to this import must use
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_bss_start.html">__ld_bss_start</A>,
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_bss_end.html">__ld_bss_end</A>, and
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_bss_size.html">__ld_bss_size</A> to query the location
    and size of the BSS section.
    <BR><BR>
    <DT><B>__handle_relocs</B>
    <DD>This global import is created automatically if the program
    contains absolute relocation entries. If no file reacts to this import,
    relocation entries have to be handled by the output format. The file reacting
    to this import must use
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_reloc_count.html">__ld_reloc_count</A> and an
    appropriate <A HREF="ld_insert.html">insertion</A> to get information about
    the necessary relocation.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__handle_rom_calls</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the program
    contains ROM calls. If no file reacts to this import, ROM calls are handled
    by the output format. The file reacting to this import must use
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_rom_call_count.html">__ld_rom_call_count</A> and an
    appropriate <A HREF="ld_insert.html">insertion</A> to get information about
    the ROM calls.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__handle_ram_calls</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the program
    contains RAM calls. If no file reacts to this import, RAM calls are handled
    by the output format. The file reacting to this import must use
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_ram_call_count.html">__ld_ram_call_count</A> and an
    appropriate <A HREF="ld_insert.html">insertion</A> to get information about
    the RAM calls.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__handle_libraries</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the program
    references at least one library. If no file reacts to this import, library
    calls are handled by the output format. The file reacting to this import must
    use <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_lib_count.html">__ld_lib_count</A> and an
    appropriate <A HREF="ld_insert.html">insertion</A> to get information about
    the libraries.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__handle_data_var</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the data
    section of the program is not included in the program itself but in an
    external file. The file that handles this import must open this file and
    relocate the program accordingly. It must refer to
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_data_var_name_end.html">__ld_data_var_name_end</A>,
    <A HREF="ld_symbols_ld_data_size.html">__ld_data_size</A>, and an appropriate
    <A HREF="ld_insert.html">insertion</A> for the relocation.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__data_var_create_copy</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the data
    section of the program is not included in the program itself but in an
    external file, and this file needs to be copied into memory (either always or
    under certain circumstances).
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>__data_var_copy_if_archived</B>
<DD>This global import is created automatically if the data
    section of the program is not included in the program itself but in an
    external file, and this file needs to be copied into memory only if it is
    archived. This import is created only in combination with
    __data_var_create_copy.
