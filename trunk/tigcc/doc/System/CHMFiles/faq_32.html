According to what I have read, you cannot store an immediate value (or any
non-pointer variable) to a pointer variable. You can only copy pointers of
the same type and such. Now, the books may say this, but, is there a way
to do this somehow? I want something like <CODE>'address=0x001fca;'</CODE> where
address is a pointer to a char. Is it necessary to use the assembler for this?

No. C is enough low-level language that nearly everything which can be done in
ASM can be done in pure C too (of course, pure ASM code is usually faster).
In your concrete example, using of typecasting is quite enough:
<PRE>address = (char*)0x001fca;
</PRE>
This is really a classic usage of the typecast operator. It is extremely powerful
in C language, so it may be used to convert nearly <I>everything</I> to <I>anything</I>.
This sometimes may be really terrible. For example, in early TIGCCLIB implementation, I
used strange typecasting to convert an array to a function. And, nearly all library
functions are implemented using a typecast operator which constructs an indirect function call.
For example, when you use something innocent like
<PRE>DrawStr (0, 0, "Hello", A_NORMAL);
</PRE>
the <A HREF="cpp.html">preprocessor</A> expands it into a really terrible typecast.
See <A HREF="default__rom_call.html">_rom_call</A> for more info.
