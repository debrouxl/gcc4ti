<P>The purpose of a linker is to take executable code and data from different
files and merge it into a single program. It must resolve dependencies
between the files, and there are many architecture-dependent features linkers
are required to support. The complicated part about linking is that binary
code can be encapsulated in different formats; most linkers, including the
GCC4TI linker, can import code from several formats and export it to yet
another one (see <A HREF="ld_formats.html">GCC4TI Linker File Formats</A>).
<BR><BR>
The GCC4TI linker can handle two kinds of files: object files and archive
files. Object files are produced by the compiler or assembler. They contain
the code and global variables of the program; all object files passed to the
linker are processed and then included in the final output. Archive files,
also known as static libraries, are collections of object files. An archive
member is included only if this is requested by another file.
<BR><BR>
Files can reference each other via text strings called <U>symbols</U>. These
symbols are usually labels in assembly code, or functions and global
variables in C code. The most popular way of referencing symbols is to ask
that the final address or offset of a specific symbol be inserted at or added
to a specific location in the code. This is called <U>relocation</U>.
<BR><BR>
When the linker is executed, it first reads all object files passed to it and
imports their contents into its internal data structures. Then it tries to
resolve the references to symbols defined in another file. If a symbol cannot
be resolved, it is looked up in the symbol tables of all archive files passed
to the linker; if it is still not found, this is an error. Archive members
are imported immediately if required, and they may reference symbols defined
in other files as well. Some special actions are performed based on the
contents of the imported files, code and data blocks (<U>sections</U>) are
sorted and merged if required, and offsets between different locations in the
code are inserted whereever the object files requested this. Finally, the
program is exported to an executable file.
