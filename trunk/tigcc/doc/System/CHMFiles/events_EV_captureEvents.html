<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>Sets the event message handler (i.e. installs an event driven application).</B>
<P>EV_captureEvents sets a new event message handler to the routine pointed to by <I>NewHandler</I>,
overriding any current handler. <I>NewHandler</I> is the pointer of type <A HREF="events_EVENT_HANDLER.html">EVENT_HANDLER</A>,
which is the pointer to a void function (i.e. procedure) which accepts one parameter of
<A HREF="events_EVENT.html">EVENT</A> type. If <I>NewHandler</I> is <A HREF="alloc_NULL.html">NULL</A>,
EV_captureEvents restores the standard event handler (which depends on the current application
like "Home Screen", "Graph", etc.). EV_captureEvents returns the pointer to the previous installed
event handler.

Any event handler is, in fact, an event driven application. All built-in flash applications like
"Home screen", "Graph", "Text editor", "Geometry" etc. and all add-in flash applications are event driven applications. Also,
"About" and "Catalog" dialogs and "Error message" dialogs are also event driven applications
(maybe the word "applets" is better for them). The whole idea of event driving is as follows:
instead of having an application which has an internal "main loop" in which all processing are
performed, an event driven application accepts a message (or event), checks the type of the
event (a keypress is, for example, one type of the event), process it, then exits immediately
after processing the event. So, the user needs to make a loop in which necessary events are
collected and dispatched (using <A HREF="events_EV_sendEvent.html">EV_sendEvent</A>) to the application.
The main advantage of such an approach is in the fact that the main loop is under the control of
the user, even if the application itself may be written by somebody else. So, the user can
decide in the loop what events will be sent to an application etc. This would not be possible
if the "main loop" is the part of the application itself. For example, if the user makes a
loop in which events are dispatched to two or more applications, it is easy to estabilish a
kind of multitasking. Note that each modern operating system (for example Windows or UNIX) is
based on such event dispatching/handling mechanism!
<BR><BR>
To understand more about event driven applications, you need to read about all other
functions in this header file (especially <A HREF="events_EV_eventLoop.html">EV_eventLoop</A>,
<A HREF="events_EV_sendEvent.html">EV_sendEvent</A> and <A HREF="events_EV_defaultHandler.html">EV_defaultHandler</A>
may be very useful in user programs). Probably the most frequent usage of these functions in
user programs will be to access the text editor
application (see <A HREF="textedit.html">textedit.h</A> header file), which is event driven.
In this header file, there is also a good example about using some event functions.

current handler, it is better to use <A HREF="events_EV_hook.html">EV_hook</A>.
