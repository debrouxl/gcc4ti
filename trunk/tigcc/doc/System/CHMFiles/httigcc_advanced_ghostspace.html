<P>Sometimes, on hardware version 2, it is necessary to execute a program in the
so-called "ghost space", which is the area of addresses above 0x40000. If you
need to know more about this, read the
<A HREF="faq_49.html">launcher</A> FAQ entry. If you put
<PRE>#define EXECUTE_IN_GHOST_SPACE
</PRE>
at the beginning of your program, on hardware version 2 (and 1, for
backwards compatibility reasons), the program will automatically be 
executed in the ghost space. This causes an overhead of about 200 bytes.
More precisely, it will <B>relocate</B> itself in the ghost space (by
applying <A HREF="system_EX_patch.html">EX_patch</A> to itself with the
start address increased by 0x40000) before entering the ghost space.
Everything will be performed <I>before</I> anything else. Therefore, there
are no limitations introduced by this directive on hardware versions 1 and 2,
whereas the older
<A HREF="system_enter_ghost_space.html">enter_ghost_space</A> function
was very limited and hard to use.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>EXECUTE_IN_GHOST_SPACE</CODE> allows the user to simply call one
program from another, without worrying about the AMS protections which
usually prevent this.
<BR><BR>
Unfortunately, on hardware version 3 (TI-89 Titanium), it is not possible
anymore to bypass the execution protection this way. EXECUTE_IN_GHOST_SPACE
detects hardware version 3 and requires a FlashROM patch to be present,
refusing the execution otherwise. The name might be changed in future versions
of GCC4TI to reflect this. Therefore, you need to know that you should
<I>not</I> blindly add 0x40000 to an address, because this does not work <I>at
all</I> on the TI-89 Titanium. Instead, use <CODE>HW_VERSION==2?0x40000:0</CODE>
or <CODE>HW_VERSION&lt;=2?0x40000:0</CODE> as appropriate.
