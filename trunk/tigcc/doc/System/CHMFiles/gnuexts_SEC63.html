<P>A compound statement enclosed in parentheses may appear as an expression
in GNU C.  This allows you to use loops, switches, and local variables
within an expression.
<BR><BR>
Recall that a compound statement is a sequence of statements surrounded
by braces; in this construct, parentheses go around the braces.  For
example:
<PRE>({ int y = foo (); int z;
   if (y &gt; 0) z = y;
   else z = - y;
   z; })
</PRE>
is a valid (though slightly more complex than necessary) expression
for the absolute value of <CODE>foo&nbsp;()</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
The last thing in the compound statement should be an expression
followed by a semicolon; the value of this subexpression serves as the
value of the entire construct.  (If you use some other kind of statement
last within the braces, the construct has type <CODE><A HREF="keywords_void.html">void</A></CODE>, and thus
effectively no value.)
<BR><BR>
This feature is especially useful in making macro definitions &quot;safe&quot; (so
that they evaluate each operand exactly once).  For example, the
&quot;maximum&quot; function is commonly defined as a macro in standard C as
follows:
<PRE>#define max(a,b) ((a) &gt; (b) ? (a) : (b))
</PRE>
But this definition computes either <I>a</I> or <I>b</I> twice, with bad
results if the operand has side effects.  In GNU C, if you know the
type of the operands (here let's assume <CODE><A HREF="keywords_int.html">int</A></CODE>), you can define
the macro safely as follows:
<PRE>#define maxint(a,b) \
  ({int _a = (a), _b = (b); _a &gt; _b ? _a : _b; })
</PRE>
Embedded statements are not allowed in constant expressions, such as
the value of an enumeration constant, the width of a bit-field, or
the initial value of a static variable.
<BR><BR>
If you don't know the type of the operand, you can still do this, but you
must use <CODE><A HREF="gnuexts_SEC69.html">typeof</A></CODE>.
