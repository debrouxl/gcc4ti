<B>?? ??, ??: GCC4TI v0.96 Beta 11, ld-tigcc v1.09, Library v2.73, IDE v2.96</B>

<UL>
<LI>Added: documentation: merged several long-standing contributions, added brand-new ones.
<LI>Added: imported dasm-tigcc to a public repository, fixed a bug and upgraded some files.
dasm-tigcc is a GPL'ed improved replacement of ttdasm, which uses the GDB disassembler and
modified chunks of code from libti* & TIEmu. Creator: Kevin Kofler.
<LI>Bugfix: tigcclib: fix bsearch() while making it smaller.
<LI>Improved: tigcclib: make qsort() faster, especially for large arrays, and significantly smaller.
<LI>Added: testcases: new area for complex tests, with a test for sorting routines.
<LI>Bugfix: tigcclib: switch sprite routines to explicit register parameters.
<LI>Added: tigcclib: generic clipped sprite 8/16/32 routines.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Bugfix: IDEs: add more instructions to the default lists used for syntax coloring.
<LI>Added: import most of the TI-68k Developer Utilities' "pctools" (formerly TIGCC Tools
Suite) where they belong.
<LI>Added: documentation: merged several long-standing contributions.
<LI>Updated: pstarter: removed the essentially unused shrnklib support; optimized the
ttunpack-fast code by applying the same calling convention changes as those applied in the
ttunpack code (saves about 34 bytes, i.e. > 2%).
<LI>Improved: tprbuilder: return a nonzero exit code if a command run by tprbuilder returned
a nonzero exit code.
<LI>Bugfix: examples: fix an example whose build has failed since an untested modification
performed in 2005...
<LI>Added: examples: scripts to check buildability (with tprbuilder) of the examples.
<LI>Bugfix: gcc: fix a 64-bit compatibility problem in the AMS float support (patch applied on
top of GCC), which triggered harmless warnings in the generated assembly code.
<LI>Greatly improved: build scripts ("canadian cross"-compilation support, more traces, better
portability, improved packaging, etc.). Most improvements were developed by Lionel Debroux and
Patrick Pélissier.
<LI>Bugfix: tigcc: fix the build of the Custom DLL example by adding "-n" when invoking ld-tigcc
to generate the decompressor+launcher.
<LI>Bugfix: examples: rename a number of examples to avoid on-calc name clashes.
<LI>Updated: a number of size optimizations in TIGCCLIB, one of which touches the very commonly
used SAVE_SCREEN startup code. Most optimizations were developed by Martial Demolins.
<LI>Updated: history files and READMEs.
</UL>

<B>January 3, 2009: GCC4TI v0.96 Beta 9, ld-tigcc v1.08, Library v2.71, IDE v2.95</B>

file name for the data variable).
<LI>Added: ld-tigcc: better handling of on-calc variable names.
<LI>Bugfix: ld-tigcc: ignore "relative reloc to symbol in different section" error in the
".deleted" section. This fixes --remove-unused with debugging information and -freg-relative-an.

up at the end and not the place of the last relocation in the standalone version.
<LI>Updated: documentation tools: replace Delphi DumpSections with equivalent shell script,
Port ConvertTexi from Delphi to C++ with Qt 4.
<LI>Bugfix: ld-tigcc: fix "relative reloc at `0xnnn' to `foo' in different section" errors
when using --remove-unused with debugging information and relocated ROM_CALLs, RAM_CALLs or 
library calls.
<LI>Added: start the GCC4TI fork of TIGCC, with a different decision scheme.
<LI>Added: ld-tigcc: support for Flash OS timestamps.
<LI>Added: tigcclib: Flash OS library (flashos.a).
<LI>Added: includes: stdint.h and a partial inttypes.h (the platform's vcbprintf doesn't
support 64-bit integers anyway).

symbol.
<LI>Updated: Delphi IDE: restore VTI support <B>in addition to</B> TIEmu support, as

under Windows 9x/Me anymore.

<LI>Bugfix: <CODE>A68k</CODE> doesn't crash on EQUs doing arithmetic with other EQUs which do
arithmetic with undefined symbols anymore, this invalid code now gives a proper error message.
<LI>Bugfix: Fixed <CODE>-v</CODE> and <CODE>-v0</CODE> being limited to 255 characters in the

<CODE>OS.h</CODE> on case-insensitive file systems.

<LI>Bugfix: C symbols that where exported out-of-order by GCC (i.e.
<CODE>library@0000</CODE>, <CODE>library@0002</CODE>, <CODE>library@0001</CODE>...)
are now inserted properly in the <CODE>.89z</CODE>/<CODE>.9xz</CODE> file. This will make it possibe to write libraries in C the way it should be done.
<LI>Bugfix: The <CODE>_comment</CODE> symbol is now properly recognized in both C and
assembly programs.
Added: Both <CODE>tigcc</CODE> and <CODE>link</CODE> now have the <B>'-q'</B>
