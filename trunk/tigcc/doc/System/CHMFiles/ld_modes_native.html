<P>This mode (which can be enabled using the <B>'--native'</B>
<A HREF="ld_invocation_ld.html">command-line option</A> or the control symbol
<A HREF="ld_control_tigcc_native.html">_tigcc_native</A>) is the
recommended mode for all new programs. When operating in this mode, the GCC4TI
linker does not process the program in any special way, except that it
requires the definition of at least one startup section. The idea is that
stub code should not be handled by the linker itself but rather included
manually by the program as needed. However, every program (regardless of the
architecture and operating system) needs to have a prolog that either
contains the location of the main entry point or is itself the startup code
of the program. On the TI platforms with official assembly program support,
execution always starts at the beginning of the program, so the prolog is
actually the startup code.
<BR><BR>
Ideally, every program should be able to use this mode. However, at the
moment, the output file format cannot be specified other than by switching to
the appropriate mode. If you want to use a different output file format than
the default TIOS format (i.e. Nostub DLL or Fargo II), you cannot use
GCC4TI-native mode. At the moment, adding support for explicit selection of
the output file format does not have any particular benefit, since it does
not permit the removal of any of the other modes. However, as soon as the
need for another output format (e.g. raw) arises, there should be a
command-line option to select the format.
