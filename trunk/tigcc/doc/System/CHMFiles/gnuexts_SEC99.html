<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>Local register variables in specific registers do not reserve the
registers.  The compiler's data flow analysis is capable of determining
where the specified registers contain live values, and where they are
available for other uses.  Stores into local register variables may be deleted
when they appear to be dead according to dataflow analysis.  References
to local register variables may be deleted or moved or simplified.</B>
<P>These local variables are sometimes convenient for use with the extended
<CODE>asm</CODE> feature (see the section <A HREF="gnuexts_SEC94.html">Assembler
Instructions with C Expression Operands</A>), if you want to write one
output of the assembler instruction directly into a particular register
(this will work provided the register you specify fits the constraints
specified for that operand in the <CODE>asm</CODE> block).
<BR><BR>
You can define a local register variable with a specified register
like this:
<PRE>register int *foo asm (&quot;a5&quot;);
</PRE>
Here <CODE>a5</CODE> is the name of the register which should be used.  Note
that this is the same syntax used for defining global register
variables, but for a local variable it would appear within a function.
<BR><BR>
Naturally the register name is cpu-dependent, but this is not a
problem, since specific registers are most often useful with explicit
assembler instructions (see the section <A HREF="gnuexts_SEC94.html">Assembler Instructions with C
Expression Operands</A>), which is CPU-specific as well, and since GCC4TI
only supports exactly one CPU (the Motorola 68000) anyway.
<BR><BR>
In addition, operating systems on one type of cpu may differ in how they
name the registers; then you would need additional conditionals.  For
example, some 68000 operating systems call this register <CODE>%a5</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
Defining such a register variable does not reserve the register; it
remains available for other uses in places where flow control determines
the variable's value is not live.  However, these registers are made
unavailable for use in the reload pass; excessive use of this feature
leaves the compiler too few available registers to compile certain
functions.
<BR><BR>
This option does not guarantee that GCC will generate code that has
this variable in the register you specify at all times.  You may not
code an explicit reference to this register in an <CODE>asm</CODE> statement
and assume it will always refer to this variable.
<BR><BR>
Stores into local register variables may be deleted when they appear to be dead
according to dataflow analysis.  References to local register variables may
be deleted or moved or simplified.
