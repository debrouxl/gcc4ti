<P>Sometimes you may want to convert a macro argument into a string
constant.  Parameters are not replaced inside string constants, but you
can use the <CODE>#</CODE> preprocessing operator instead.  When a macro
parameter is used with a leading <CODE>#</CODE>, the preprocessor replaces it
with the literal text of the actual argument, converted to a string
constant.  Unlike normal parameter replacement, the argument is not
macro-expanded first.  This is called <U>stringification</U>.
<BR><BR>
There is no way to combine an argument with surrounding text and
stringify it all together.  Instead, you can write a series of adjacent
string constants and stringified arguments.  The preprocessor will
replace the stringified arguments with string constants.  The C
compiler will then combine all the adjacent string constants into one
long string.
<BR><BR>
Here is an example of a macro definition that uses stringification:
<PRE>#define WARN_IF(EXP) \
do { if (EXP) \
        fprintf (stderr, &quot;Warning: &quot; #EXP &quot;\n&quot;); } \
while (0)
WARN_IF (x == 0);
     expands to do { if (x == 0)
           fprintf (stderr, &quot;Warning: &quot; &quot;x == 0&quot; &quot;\n&quot;); } while (0);
</PRE>
The argument for <CODE>EXP</CODE> is substituted once, as-is, into the
<CODE>if</CODE> statement, and once, stringified, into the argument to
<CODE>fprintf</CODE>.  If <CODE>x</CODE> were a macro, it would be expanded in the
<CODE>if</CODE> statement, but not in the string.
<BR><BR>
The <CODE>do</CODE> and <CODE>while&nbsp;(0)</CODE> are a kludge to make it possible to
write <CODE>WARN_IF&nbsp;(<I>arg</I>);</CODE>, which the resemblance of
<CODE>WARN_IF</CODE> to a function would make C programmers want to do; see
<A HREF="cpp_SEC25.html">Swallowing the Semicolon</A>.
<BR><BR>
Stringification in C involves more than putting double-quote characters
around the fragment.  The preprocessor backslash-escapes the quotes
surrounding embedded string constants, and all backslashes within string and
character constants, in order to get a valid C string constant with the
proper contents.  Thus, stringifying <CODE>p&nbsp;=&nbsp;&quot;foo\n&quot;;</CODE> results in
<CODE>&quot;p&nbsp;=&nbsp;\&quot;foo\\n\&quot;;&quot;</CODE>.  However, backslashes that are not inside string
or character constants are not duplicated: <CODE>\n</CODE> by itself
stringifies to <CODE>&quot;\n&quot;</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
All leading and trailing whitespace in text being stringified is
ignored.  Any sequence of whitespace in the middle of the text is
converted to a single space in the stringified result.  Comments are
replaced by whitespace long before stringification happens, so they
never appear in stringified text.

There is no way to convert a macro argument into a character constant.
<BR><BR>
If you want to stringify the result of expansion of a macro argument,
you have to use two levels of macros.
<PRE>#define xstr(s) str(s)
#define str(s) #s
#define foo 4
str (foo)
     expands to &quot;foo&quot;
xstr (foo)
     expands to xstr (4)
     expands to str (4)
     expands to &quot;4&quot;
</PRE>
<CODE>s</CODE> is stringified when it is used in <CODE>str</CODE>, so it is not
macro-expanded first.  But <CODE>s</CODE> is an ordinary argument to
<CODE>xstr</CODE>, so it is completely macro-expanded before <CODE>xstr</CODE>
itself is expanded (see <A HREF="cpp_SEC28.html">Argument Prescan</A>).  Therefore, by the time
<CODE>str</CODE> gets to its argument, it has already been macro-expanded.
