<P>GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC.
However, this manual is not meant to explain anything about the internals of
GCC, so you will have to go to the
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html">official version</A>
of this page on the internet if you want to debug GCC itself.
<BR><BR>
In order to debug GCC4TI C programs at a source level, you need a GDB-enabled
version of the TiEmu emulator.
<DL>
<DT><B>-g</B>
<DD>Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs is the default for the MC68000).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.
Note that the <CODE>tigcc</CODE> frontend defaults to DWARF 2 debugging
information instead, see <A HREF="comopts_SEC3.html">Options Available in the
Command Line Compiler</A>.
<BR><BR>
Unlike most other C compilers, GCC allows you to use <B>'-g'</B> with
<B>'-O'</B>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.
<BR><BR>
Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
<BR><BR>
The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-ggdb</B>
<DD>Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available, including GDB extensions if at all
possible.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-gstabs</B>
<DD>Produce debugging information in stabs format.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-gstabs+</B>
<DD>Produce debugging information in stabs format,
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-gcoff</B>
<DD>Produce debugging information in COFF format.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-g<I>level</I></B>
<BR><B>-ggdb<I>level</I></B>
<BR><B>-gstabs<I>level</I></B>
<BR><B>-gcoff<I>level</I></B>
<DD>Request debugging information and also use <I>level</I> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
<BR><BR>
Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.
<BR><BR>
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <B>'-g3'</B>.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-p</B>
<DD>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <CODE>prof</CODE>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
This option is probably useless in GCC4TI.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-pg</B>
<DD>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
analysis program <CODE>gprof</CODE>.  You must use this option when compiling
the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
linking.
This option is probably useless in GCC4TI.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-Q</B>
<DD>Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-save-temps</B>
<DD>Store the usual &quot;temporary&quot; intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling <CODE>foo.c</CODE> with <B>'-c -save-temps'</B> would produce files
<CODE>foo.i</CODE> and <CODE>foo.s</CODE>, as well as <CODE>foo.o</CODE>.  This creates a
preprocessed <CODE>foo.i</CODE> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
