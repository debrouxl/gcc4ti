<P>Defining this symbol in a source file tells the linker that this file does
not depend on the initialization of the BSS section to zero. The result is
that all uninitialized global variables defined in that file may contain
garbage at the beginning of the program. This does not guarantee that the
initialization is skipped; in fact, if at least one file needs the
initialization, it is easier to initialize even the variables that were
declared to not need it.
<BR><BR>
For pointer-based object file formats (such as COFF, the format used by the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</A> tools included in GCC4TI), this symbol
really affects all variables in the file it is defined in. For sequential
formats (such as the AmigaOS format used by the
<A HREF="a68k.html">A68k assembler</A>), it affects only the parts
that follow the symbol. Since BSS data usually appears at the end of the
object file, this restriction should not have any effect.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> If you define this symbol, you should use the
<A HREF="comopts.html">compiler option</A>
<B>'-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss'</B>; otherwise even variables explicitly
initialized to zero will contain garbage.
