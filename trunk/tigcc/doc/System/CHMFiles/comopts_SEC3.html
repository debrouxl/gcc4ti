<P>These options apply only to the command line compiler.  If you want to use
the IDE instead, you do not need to worry about these topics.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>tigcc</CODE> has an important difference to the standard program
<CODE>gcc</CODE>: <CODE>tigcc</CODE> always overwrites assembly or
object files.  For example, if a file <CODE>test.c</CODE> is compiled, the
files <CODE>test.s</CODE> and <CODE>test.o</CODE> will be created and
overwritten if necessary, but they will automatically be deleted again if
neither <B>'-c'</B> nor <B>'-S'</B> are specified.
<BR><BR>
Another important difference is that <CODE>tigcc</CODE> always looks for
libraries in the <CODE>'Lib'</CODE> subfolder of the installation.
<DL>
<DT><B>-pack <I>varname</I></B>
<DD>Compress the file generated during compilation.
<I>varname</I> is the name of the on-calc packed variable.  Although
<I>varname</I> cannot have an extension, the variable on the calculator will
always have the extension <CODE>ppg</CODE>.  <I>varname</I> cannot be the
same as the on-calc name of the program itself.  When you use this switch,
two files will be created; one with the extension <CODE>.89y</CODE> or
<CODE>.9xy</CODE>, and one <CODE>.89z</CODE> or <CODE>.9xz</CODE> file.
<BR><BR>
This option comes from
<A HREF="mailto:thomas.nussbaumer@gmx.net">Thomas Nussbaumer</A>'s
TI-68k Developer Utilities (now built in GCC4TI), where this feature is called
"ExePack Technology." You can read about it on the official
<A HREF="http://tict.ticalc.org/">TI-Chess Team site</A>.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-q</B>
<DD>Keep as quiet as possible while assembling and linking.  This option is
not needed by the compiler because it is always quiet, but the linker and
especially the assembler output some information.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-v0</B>
<DD>This switch is an addition to the <B>'-v'</B> switch.  It tells GCC4TI to
output only the commands that are run directly.  This was the default in some
previous releases.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-g</B>
<DD>The <B>'-g'</B> switch in GCC turns on debugging information in the
preferred format for the target. In GCC4TI, this is DWARF 2, which can be used
with a GDB-enabled TiEmu.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-standalone</B>
<DD>Do not link against <CODE>tigcc.a</CODE>.  All of GCC's internal
functions are implemented in this library, as well as all non-TIOS functions.
Using one of these will result in an error from the linker.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-ar</B>
<DD>Create an archive (a static library) instead of a program.  The resulting
file will have an <CODE>.a</CODE> ending.
<BR><BR>
<DT><B>-bsr</B>
<DD>This option is ignored for compatibility.
</DL>
In addition to these options, the <CODE>tigcc</CODE> program also accepts
most of the <A HREF="ld_invocation.html">linker options</A>.
