<P>An <U>object-like macro</U> is a simple identifier which will be replaced
by a code fragment.  It is called object-like because it looks like a
data object in code that uses it.  They are most commonly used to give
symbolic names to numeric constants.
<BR><BR>
You create macros with the <CODE>#define</CODE> directive.  <CODE>#define</CODE> is
followed by the name of the macro and then the token sequence it should
be an abbreviation for, which is variously referred to as the macro's
<U>body</U>, <U>expansion</U> or <U>replacement list</U>.  For example,
<PRE>#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
</PRE>
defines a macro named <CODE>BUFFER_SIZE</CODE> as an abbreviation for the
token <CODE>1024</CODE>.  If somewhere after this <CODE>#define</CODE> directive
there comes a C statement of the form
<PRE>foo = (char *) malloc (BUFFER_SIZE);
</PRE>
then the C preprocessor will recognize and <U>expand</U> the macro
<CODE>BUFFER_SIZE</CODE>.  The C compiler will see the same tokens as it would
if you had written
<PRE>foo = (char *) malloc (1024);
</PRE>
By convention, macro names are written in upper case.  Programs are
easier to read when it is possible to tell at a glance which names are
macros.
<BR><BR>
The macro's body ends at the end of the <CODE>#define</CODE> line.  You may
continue the definition onto multiple lines, if necessary, using
backslash-newline.  When the macro is expanded, however, it will all
come out on one line.  For example,
<PRE>#define NUMBERS 1, \
                2, \
                3
int x[] = { NUMBERS };
     expands to int x[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
</PRE>
The most common visible consequence of this is surprising line numbers
in error messages.
<BR><BR>
There is no restriction on what can go in a macro body provided it
decomposes into valid preprocessing tokens.  Parentheses need not
balance, and the body need not resemble valid C code.  (If it does not,
you may get error messages from the C compiler when you use the macro.)
<BR><BR>
The C preprocessor scans your program sequentially.  Macro definitions
take effect at the place you write them.  Therefore, the following input
to the C preprocessor
<PRE>foo = X;
#define X 4
bar = X;
</PRE>
produces
<PRE>foo = X;
bar = 4;
</PRE>
When the preprocessor expands a macro name, the macro's expansion
replaces the macro invocation, then the expansion is examined for more
macros to expand.  For example,
<PRE>#define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
#define BUFSIZE 1024
TABLESIZE
     expands to BUFSIZE
     expands to 1024
</PRE>
<CODE>TABLESIZE</CODE> is expanded first to produce <CODE>BUFSIZE</CODE>, then that
macro is expanded to produce the final result, <CODE>1024</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
Notice that <CODE>BUFSIZE</CODE> was not defined when <CODE>TABLESIZE</CODE> was
defined.  The <CODE>#define</CODE> for <CODE>TABLESIZE</CODE> uses exactly the
expansion you specify - in this case, <CODE>BUFSIZE</CODE> - and does not
check to see whether it too contains macro names.  Only when you
<I>use</I> <CODE>TABLESIZE</CODE> is the result of its expansion scanned for
more macro names.
<BR><BR>
This makes a difference if you change the definition of <CODE>BUFSIZE</CODE>
at some point in the source file.  <CODE>TABLESIZE</CODE>, defined as shown,
will always expand using the definition of <CODE>BUFSIZE</CODE> that is
currently in effect:
<PRE>#define BUFSIZE 1020
#define TABLESIZE BUFSIZE
#undef BUFSIZE
#define BUFSIZE 37
</PRE>
Now <CODE>TABLESIZE</CODE> expands (in two stages) to <CODE>37</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
If the expansion of a macro contains its own name, either directly or
via intermediate macros, it is not expanded again when the expansion is
examined for more macros.  This prevents infinite recursion.
