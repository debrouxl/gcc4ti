<P CLASS="ITEMDESC"><B>Allocates memory on the local storage space.</B>
<P>alloca is a function which is not included in the ANSI C standard, but it exists in many C dialects
(including GCC4TI). It allocates a block of <I>Size</I> bytes on the CPU stack (local
storage space), in opposite to <A HREF="alloc_malloc.html">malloc</A> which allocates memory on the
memory heap. The space allocated with alloca exists until the containing function returns
(i.e. it will be automatically deallocated at the end of the function). Be aware of the
fact that the size of the hardware stack on TI calculators is limited to 16 kilobytes, so
do not use alloca for allocating large blocks.
<BR><BR>
alloca is usually used for simulating automatic variable-sized one-dimensional arrays, which will be automatically
deallocated when the function ends (like all automatic variables), so it is sometimes more
preferable than <A HREF="alloc_malloc.html">malloc</A>. For example, to simulate
<PRE>int a[n];
</PRE>
where <I>'n'</I> is not known in advance, you can use
<PRE>int *a = alloca (n);
</PRE>
Note, however, that GNU C extensions allows <A HREF="gnuexts_SEC76.html">variable-length
arrays</A>, which are more elegant than usage of alloca, and which may also be with more than
one dimension (which is not possible with alloca).
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> alloca is a built-in (open-coded) function in GNU C, which is translated to a single
instruction which simply adjusts the stack. Some compiler command options (like
<B>'-ansi'</B>) prevent alloca from being an open-coded function. In this implementation
of GCC4TI, you cannot use alloca with such options (however, it is very unlikely that you will
ever have such problems).
