<P>Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
&quot;in&quot; those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a &quot;read only&quot; section.
<BR><BR>
The linker <CODE>ld</CODE> reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When <CODE>as</CODE>
emits an object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
<CODE>ld</CODE> assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how <CODE>as</CODE> uses
sections.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>ld</CODE> moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a <I>section</I>.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called <U>relocation</U>.  It includes
the task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.
<BR><BR>
An object file written by <CODE>as</CODE> has at least three sections, any
of which may be empty.  These are named <U>text</U>, <U>data</U> and
<U>bss</U> sections.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>as</CODE> can also generate whatever other named sections you specify
using the <CODE><A HREF="gnuasm_SEC119.html">.section</A></CODE> directive.
If you do not use any directives that place output in the <CODE>.text</CODE>
or <CODE>.data</CODE> sections, these sections still exist, but are empty.
Within the object file, the text section starts at address <CODE>0</CODE>, the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.
<BR><BR>
To let <CODE>ld</CODE> know which data changes when the sections are
relocated, and how to change that data, <CODE>as</CODE> also writes to the
object file details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation
<CODE>ld</CODE> must know, each time an address in the object
file is mentioned:
<UL>
<LI>
Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to
an address?
<BR><BR>
<LI>
How long (in bytes) is this reference?
<BR><BR>
<LI>
Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric value of
(<I>address</I>) - (<I>start-address of section</I>)?
<BR><BR>
<LI>
Is the reference to an address &quot;Program-Counter relative&quot;?
</UL>
In fact, every address <CODE>as</CODE> ever uses is expressed as
(<I>section</I>) + (<I>offset into section</I>)
<BR><BR>
Further, most expressions <CODE>as</CODE> computes have this section-relative
nature.
In this manual we use the notation {<I>secname</I> <I>N</I>} to mean &quot;offset
<I>N</I> into section <I>secname</I>.&quot;
<BR><BR>
Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
<U>absolute</U> section.  When <CODE>ld</CODE> mixes partial programs,
addresses in the absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address
<CODE>{absolute&nbsp;0}</CODE> is &quot;relocated&quot; to run-time address 0 by
<CODE>ld</CODE>.  Although the linker never arranges two partial programs'
data sections with overlapping addresses after linking, <I>by definition</I>
their absolute sections must overlap.  Address <CODE>{absolute 239}</CODE> in one
part of a program is always the same address when the program is running as
address <CODE>{absolute 239}</CODE> in any other part of the program.
<BR><BR>
The idea of sections is extended to the <U>undefined</U> section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined <I>U</I>} - where <I>U</I> is filled in later.
Since numbers are always defined, the only way to generate an undefined
address is to mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named
common block would be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly
time so it has section <I>undefined</I>.
<BR><BR>
By analogy the word <I>section</I> is used to describe groups of sections in
the linked program.  <CODE>ld</CODE> puts all partial programs' text
sections in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is
customary to refer to the <I>text section</I> of a program, meaning all
the addresses of all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for
data and bss sections.
<BR><BR>
Some sections are manipulated by <CODE>ld</CODE>; others are invented for
use of <CODE>as</CODE> and have no meaning except during assembly.
