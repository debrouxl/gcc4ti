[Description]
This function has become obsolete.

[Explanation]
This function has become obsolete. You should use <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayOn)">GrayOn</A> and <A HREF="$$LINK(GrayOff)">GrayOff</A> now.
GrayMode is implemented as a macro which calls one of these two functions; if <I>mode</I> is a constant, the compiler
will optimize the code into a single function call.
