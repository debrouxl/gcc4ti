[ROM Call]
Index=$1B

[Description]
Moves the pen position (???).

[Explanation]
On the Texas Instruments site, TI comments related to this function are (cite):
use <A HREF="$$LINK(WinMoveTo)">WinMoveTo</A> to move pen position, use
<A HREF="$$LINK(WinSetCursor)">WinSetCursor</A> to move cursor. Obviously, I am too stupid
to conclude what is the difference between the pen position and the cursor. To be
more precise, I don't know what "cursor" means to them. I don't see any difference
between this command and <A HREF="$$LINK(WinMoveTo)">WinMoveTo</A>. Any info is welcomed.
If this fact may help, <A HREF="$$LINK(WinMoveTo)">WinMoveTo</A> changes CurX and CurY
fields of the <A HREF="$$LINK(WINDOW)">WINDOW</A> structure, WinMoveCursor changes both
CurX, CurY and CursorX, CursorY pairs, and <A HREF="$$LINK(WinSetCursor)">WinSetCursor</A> changes only
CursorX and CursorY field. Please help!!!
