Definition=typedef unsigned short uint_fast8_t;

[Description]
The fastest unsigned type with at least 8 bits (specified by C99).

[Explanation]
This type can be used when at least 8 bits of unsigned data storage are wanted, and speed is more of a concern than size.
In TIGCC, its size is 16 bits.
