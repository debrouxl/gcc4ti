Definition=typedef unsigned long long uint_fast64_t;

[Description]
The fastest unsigned type with at least 64 bits (specified by C99).

[Explanation]
This type can be used when at least 64 bits of unsigned data storage are wanted, and speed is more of a concern than size.
In GCC4TI, its size is exactly 64 bits.
