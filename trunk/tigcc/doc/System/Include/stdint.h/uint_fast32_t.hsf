Definition=typedef unsigned long uint_fast32_t;

[Description]
The fastest unsigned type with at least 32 bits (specified by C99).

[Explanation]
This type can be used when at least 32 bits of unsigned data storage are wanted, and speed is more of a concern than size.
In GCC4TI, its size is exactly 32 bits.
