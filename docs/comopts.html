<HR>
<P>This part of the documentation is a modified version of the
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Invoking-GCC.html">Command-Line Options</A>
section of the <A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/">GCC Manual</A>.
Therefore it is licensed under the
<A HREF="gnugpl.html#gnufdl">GNU Free Documentation License</A>.
<BR><BR>
This section describes the options supported by <CODE>gcc</CODE>,
the driver program of the GNU Compiler Collection, whose C compiler
and assembler are used here.  This program is called either by
<CODE>tigcc</CODE> or by the IDE.  <CODE>tigcc</CODE>
simulates some of these options itself, namely <B>'-E'</B>,
<B>'-S'</B>, and <B>'-c'</B>, and it also has some additional ones.
In the IDE, there is an item in the project settings where you can
set the options described here, with some exceptions, including the
switches mentioned above.
<BR><BR>
GCC4TI normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and linking
all in one step, and finally produces a file which is executable on
the calculator.  The &quot;overall options&quot; allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <B>'-c'</B> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
<BR><BR>
Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
In fact, only those options which may be more or less useful with GCC4TI
are mentioned here (although we didn't check whether all of them are
really usable in GCC4TI).  For more info about standard options that are
recognized by the compiler, read the
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Invoking-GCC.html">official manual</A>.
<BR><BR>
We suggest that you use the <B>'-O2'</B> switch in all of your
compilations; it increases speed and decreases the program size at the
cost of compilation time.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>tigcc</CODE> accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <I>not</I> be grouped: <B>'-dr'</B> is very different from <B>'-d
-r'</B>.
<BR><BR>
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several options
of the same kind; for example, if you specify <B>'-L'</B> more than once,
the directories are searched in the order specified.
<BR><BR>
Many options have long names starting with <B>'-f'</B> or with
<B>'-W'</B> - for example, <B>'-fforce-mem'</B>,
<B>'-fstrength-reduce'</B>, <B>'-Wformat'</B> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<B>'-ffoo'</B> would be <B>'-fno-foo'</B>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.</P>

<H2><A NAME="SEC3"><U>Options Available in the Command Line Compiler</U></A></H2>
<P>These options apply only to the command line compiler.  If you want to use
the IDE instead, you do not need to worry about these topics.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>tigcc</CODE> has an important difference to the standard program
<CODE>gcc</CODE>: <CODE>tigcc</CODE> always overwrites assembly or
object files.  For example, if a file <CODE>test.c</CODE> is compiled, the
files <CODE>test.s</CODE> and <CODE>test.o</CODE> will be created and
overwritten if necessary, but they will automatically be deleted again if
neither <B>'-c'</B> nor <B>'-S'</B> are specified.
<BR><BR>
Another important difference is that <CODE>tigcc</CODE> always looks for
libraries in the <CODE>'Lib'</CODE> subfolder of the installation.</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>-pack <I>varname</I></B></P><DD><P>Compress the file generated during compilation.
<I>varname</I> is the name of the on-calc packed variable.  Although
<I>varname</I> cannot have an extension, the variable on the calculator will
always have the extension <CODE>ppg</CODE>.  <I>varname</I> cannot be the
same as the on-calc name of the program itself.  When you use this switch,
two files will be created; one with the extension <CODE>.89y</CODE> or
<CODE>.9xy</CODE>, and one <CODE>.89z</CODE> or <CODE>.9xz</CODE> file.
<BR><BR>
This option comes from

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="SEC4"><U>Options Controlling the Kind of Output</U></A></H2>
<P>Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  The first three
stages apply to an individual source file, and end by producing an
object file; linking combines all the object files (those newly
compiled, and those specified as input) into an executable file.
<BR><BR>
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done (some of these apply only to TIGCC/GCC4TI):</P>

<P>You can specify the input language explicitly with the <B>'-x'</B> option:</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>-x <I>language</I></B></P><DD><P>Specify explicitly the <I>language</I> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file

the next <B>'-x'</B> option.  Possible values for <I>language</I> are:
<BR>
<CODE>

handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <B>'-x'</B>
has not been used at all).
</P><DT><P><B>-pass-exit-codes</B></P><DD><P>Normally the <CODE>gcc</CODE> program will exit with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
<B>'-pass-exit-codes'</B>, the <CODE>gcc</CODE> program will instead return with
numerically highest error produced by any phase that returned an error
indication.</P>
</DL>
<P>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<B>'-x'</B> (or filename suffixes) to tell <CODE>gcc</CODE> where to start, and
one of the options <B>'-c'</B>, <B>'-S'</B>, or <B>'-E'</B> to say where
<CODE>gcc</CODE> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
<B>'-x cpp-output -E'</B>) instruct <CODE>gcc</CODE> to do nothing at all.</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>-c</B></P><DD><P>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
<BR><BR>
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <CODE>.c</CODE>, <CODE>.i</CODE>, <CODE>.s</CODE>, etc., with <CODE>.o</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.

<BR><BR>
By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <CODE>.c</CODE>, <CODE>.i</CODE>, etc., with <CODE>.s</CODE>.
<BR><BR>
Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
</P><DT><P><B>-E</B></P><DD><P>Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The

sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
<BR><BR>
Since only one output file can be specified, it does not make sense to
use <B>'-o'</B> when compiling more than one input file, unless you are
producing an executable file as output.
<BR><BR>
If <B>'-o'</B> is not specified, the default is to put an executable file
in <CODE>a.out</CODE>, the object file for <CODE><I>source</I>.<I>suffix</I></CODE> in
<CODE><I>source</I>.o</CODE>, its assembler file in <CODE><I>source</I>.s</CODE>, and
all preprocessed C source on standard output.
</P><DT><P><B>-v</B></P><DD><P>Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages

invoked by <CODE>gcc</CODE>, so that they can display the command line options
they accept.  If the <B>'-W'</B> option is also specified then command
line options which have no documentation associated with them will also
be displayed.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="SEC6"><U>Options Controlling C Dialect</U></A></H2>
<P>The following options control the dialect of C that the compiler accepts:</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>-ansi</B></P><DD><P>Support all ISO C89 programs.
This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C89,
such as the <CODE>asm</CODE> and <CODE>typeof</CODE> keywords, and
some predefined macros that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature, and disables recognition of C++ style
<CODE>//</CODE> comments as well as the <CODE>inline</CODE> keyword.
<BR><BR>
The alternate keywords <CODE>__asm__</CODE>, <CODE>__extension__</CODE>,
<CODE>__inline__</CODE> and <CODE>__typeof__</CODE> continue to work despite
<B>'-ansi'</B>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <B>'-ansi'</B>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <CODE>__unix__</CODE> are also available, with or
without <B>'-ansi'</B>.
<BR><BR>
The <B>'-ansi'</B> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <B>'-pedantic'</B> is required in
addition to <B>'-ansi'</B>.  See <A HREF="#SEC8">Warning Options</A>.
<BR><BR>
The macro <CODE>__STRICT_ANSI__</CODE> is predefined when the <B>'-ansi'</B>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
<BR><BR>
Functions which would normally be built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as <A HREF="alloc.html#alloca">alloca</A>) are not built-in
functions with <B>'-ansi'</B> is used.  See <A HREF="gnuexts.html#SEC104">Other
built-in functions provided by GCC</A> for details of the functions
affected.
<BR><BR>
<B>Note:</B> At the moment, the GCC4TI library depends heavily on GNU C extensions,

Even when this option is not specified, you can still use some of the
features of newer standards in so far as they do not conflict with
previous C standards.  For example, you may use <CODE>__restrict__</CODE> even
when <B>'-std=c99'</B> is not specified.
<BR><BR>
The <B>'-std'</B> options specifying some version of ISO C have the same
effects as <B>'-ansi'</B>, except that features that were not in ISO C90

Besides declarations, the file indicates, in comments, the origin of
each declaration (source file and line), whether the declaration was
implicit, prototyped or unprototyped (<CODE>I</CODE>, <CODE>N</CODE> for new or
<CODE>O</CODE> for old, respectively, in the first character after the line
number and the colon), and whether it came from a declaration or a

including those which are not built-in functions when <B>'-ansi'</B> or
<B>'-std'</B> options for strict ISO C conformance are used because they
do not have an ISO standard meaning.
<BR><BR>
GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <A HREF="alloc.html#alloca">alloca</A> may become single
instructions that adjust the stack directly.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.

only the built-in function <I>function</I> is
disabled.  <I>function</I> must not begin with <CODE>__builtin_</CODE>.  If a
function is named this is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<B>'-fbuiltin-<I>function</I>'</B> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <B>'-fno-builtin'</B> or
<B>'-ffreestanding'</B>, you may define macros such as:</P>
<PRE>#define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))

Ideally, a portable program should always use <CODE>signed&nbsp;char</CODE> or

But many programs have been written to use plain <CODE>char</CODE> and

make such a program work with the opposite default.

<H2><A NAME="SEC8"><U>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</U></A></H2>
<P>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
<BR><BR>
You can request many specific warnings with options beginning <B>'-W'</B>,
for example <B>'-Wimplicit'</B> to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning <B>'-Wno-'</B> to turn off warnings;
for example, <B>'-Wno-implicit'</B>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.
<BR><BR>
The following options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced
by GCC.</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>-fsyntax-only</B></P><DD><P>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.
</P><DT><P><B>-pedantic</B></P><DD><P>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C.  This option follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <B>'-std'</B> option used.
<BR><BR>
Valid ISO C programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few will require <B>'-ansi'</B> or a
<B>'-std'</B> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
<BR><BR>
<B>'-pedantic'</B> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <CODE>__</CODE>.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<CODE>__extension__</CODE>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
See <A HREF="gnuexts.html#SEC100">Alternate Keywords</A>.
<BR><BR>
Some users try to use <B>'-pedantic'</B> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all - only those for which
ISO C <I>requires</I> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
<BR><BR>
A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <B>'-pedantic'</B>.  The GNU team doesn't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
<BR><BR>
Where the standard specified with <B>'-std'</B> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as <CODE>gnu89</CODE> or <CODE>gnu99</CODE>, there is a
corresponding <U>base standard</U>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <B>'-pedantic'</B> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It would not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)

<BR><BR>
Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<CODE><A HREF="keywords.html#if">if</A></CODE> statement an <CODE><A HREF="keywords.html#if">else</A></CODE> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:</P>
<PRE>{

<P>In C, every <CODE>else</CODE> branch belongs to the innermost possible <CODE>if</CODE>

what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above example by the
indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the potential for this
confusion, GCC will issue a warning when this flag is specified.
To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around the innermost
<CODE>if</CODE> statement so there is no way the <CODE>else</CODE> could belong to
the enclosing <CODE>if</CODE>.  The resulting code would look like this:</P>
<PRE>{

</PRE>

<DT><P><B>-Wsequence-point</B></P><DD><P>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C standard.
<BR><BR>
The C standard defines the order in which expressions in a C program are
evaluated in terms of <U>sequence points</U>, which represent a partial
ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those executed
before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These occur
after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a
larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<CODE>&amp;&amp;</CODE>, <CODE>||</CODE>, <CODE>?&nbsp;:</CODE> or <CODE>,</CODE> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
<BR><BR>
It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C standard specifies that &quot;Between the
previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value
modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.  Furthermore,
the prior value shall be read only to determine the value to be
stored.&quot;.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
<BR><BR>
Examples of code with undefined behavior are <CODE>a&nbsp;=&nbsp;a++;</CODE>, <CODE>a[n]
=&nbsp;b[n++]</CODE> and <CODE>a[i++]&nbsp;=&nbsp;i;</CODE>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
<BR><BR>
The C standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.

definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at

These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
because they require data flow information that is computed only
when optimizing.  If you don't specify <B>'-O'</B>, you simply won't
get these warnings.
<BR><BR>
These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable that
is declared <CODE><A HREF="keywords.html#volatile">volatile</A></CODE>, or whose address is taken, or whose size
is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.
<BR><BR>
Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
<BR><BR>
These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart
enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:</P>
<PRE>{
  int x;
  switch (y)
    {
    case 1: x = 1;
      break;
    case 2: x = 4;

    case 3: x = 5;
    }
  foo (x);
}
</PRE>
<P>If the value of <I>y</I> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <I>x</I> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.  Here is
another common case:</P>
<PRE>{
  int save_y;
  if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
  ...
  if (change_y) y = save_y;
}
</PRE>
<P>This has no bug because <I>save_y</I> is used only if it is set.
<BR><BR>
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <A HREF="setjmp.html#longjmp">longjmp</A>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation
(although I am not sure whether they can be caught at all in GCC4TI).
<BR><BR>
The compiler sees only the calls to <A HREF="setjmp.html#setjmp">setjmp</A>.  It cannot know
where <A HREF="setjmp.html#longjmp">longjmp</A> will be called; in fact, an interrupt handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <A HREF="setjmp.html#longjmp">longjmp</A> cannot
in fact be called at the place which would cause a problem.
<BR><BR>

The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the

to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you

this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

This option is intended to warn when the compiler detects that at

some condition is never satisfied or because it is after a
procedure that never returns.
<BR><BR>
It is possible for this option to produce a warning even though there
are circumstances under which part of the affected line can be executed,
so care should be taken when removing apparently-unreachable code.
<BR><BR>
For instance, when a function is inlined, a warning may mean that the
line is unreachable in only one inlined copy of the function.
<BR><BR>
This option is not made part of <B>'-Wall'</B> because in a debugging

The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the

<H2><A NAME="SEC9"><U>Options for Debugging Your Program</U></A></H2>
<P>GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC.
However, this manual is not meant to explain anything about the internals of
GCC, so you will have to go to the
<A HREF="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html">official version</A>
of this page on the internet if you want to debug GCC itself.
<BR><BR>
In order to debug GCC4TI C programs at a source level, you need a GDB-enabled
version of the TiEmu emulator.</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>-g</B></P><DD><P>Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs is the default for the MC68000).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.
Note that the <CODE>tigcc</CODE> frontend defaults to DWARF 2 debugging
information instead, see <A HREF="#SEC3">Options Available in the
Command Line Compiler</A>.
<BR><BR>
Unlike most other C compilers, GCC allows you to use <B>'-g'</B> with
<B>'-O'</B>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values were already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they were moved out of loops.
<BR><BR>
Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
<BR><BR>
The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.
</P><DT><P><B>-ggdb</B></P><DD><P>Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the
most expressive format available, including GDB extensions if at all

<BR><B>-gcoff<I>level</I></B></P><DD><P>Request debugging information and also use <I>level</I> to specify how
much information.  The default level is 2.
<BR><BR>
Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in
parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This includes
descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.
<BR><BR>
Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions

<CODE>foo.i</CODE> and <CODE>foo.s</CODE>, as well as <CODE>foo.o</CODE>.  This creates a
preprocessed <CODE>foo.i</CODE> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.</P>
</DL>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="SEC10"><U>Options That Control Optimization</U></A></H2>
<P>These options control various sorts of optimizations.
<BR><BR>
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.
<BR><BR>
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
<BR><BR>
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed.</P>
<DL>

<I>n</I> is the size of functions that can be inlined in
number of pseudo instructions (not counting parameter handling).  The default
value of <I>n</I> is 600.
Increasing this value can result in more inlined code at
the cost of compilation time and memory consumption.  Decreasing usually makes
the compilation faster and less code will be inlined (which presumably
means slower programs).  This option is particularly useful for programs that
use inlining heavily.
<BR><BR>
Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <B>'--param <I>name</I>=<I>value</I>'</B>.

not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use <B>'-isystem'</B> for that).  If you use more than

system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and

<H2><A NAME="SEC15"><U>GCC Spec Strings</U></A></H2>
<P><CODE>gcc</CODE> is a driver program.  It performs its job by invoking a
sequence of other programs to do the work of compiling, assembling and
linking.  GCC interprets its command-line parameters and uses these to
deduce which programs it should invoke, and which command-line options
it ought to place on their command lines.  This behavior is controlled
by <U>spec strings</U>.  In most cases there is one spec string for each
program that GCC can invoke, but a few programs have multiple spec
strings to control their behavior.  The spec strings built into GCC can
be overridden by using the <B>'-specs='</B> command-line switch to specify
a spec file.
<BR><BR>
<U>Spec files</U> are plaintext files that are used to construct spec
strings.  They consist of a sequence of directives separated by blank

<BR><BR>
This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls will indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <CODE>extern&nbsp;inline</CODE> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyways, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
<BR><BR>
A function may be given the attribute <CODE>no_instrument_function</CODE>, in
which case this instrumentation will not be done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

<H2><A NAME="SEC45"><U>Environment Variables Affecting GCC</U></A></H2>
<P>This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
<BR><BR>
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<B>'-B'</B>, <B>'-I'</B> and <B>'-L'</B> (see <A HREF="#SEC14">Options for Directory Search</A>).</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>LANG</B>
<BR><B>LC_CTYPE</B>
<BR><B>LC_MESSAGES</B>
<BR><B>LC_ALL</B></P><DD><P>These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information that allow GCC to work with different
national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
<CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> and <CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is <CODE>en_UK</CODE> for English in the United
Kingdom.
<BR><BR>
The <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> environment variable specifies character
classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that would otherwise be interpreted as a string
end or escape.
<BR><BR>
The <CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
<BR><BR>
If the <CODE>LC_ALL</CODE> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE> and <CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE>; otherwise, <CODE>LC_CTYPE</CODE>
and <CODE>LC_MESSAGES</CODE> default to the value of the <CODE>LANG</CODE>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
</P><DT><P><B>TMPDIR</B></P><DD><P>If <CODE>TMPDIR</CODE> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
</P><DT><P><B>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</B></P><DD><P>If <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
<BR><BR>
If <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is not set, GCC will attempt to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.
<BR><BR>
If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
<BR><BR>
The default value of <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE> is
<CODE><I>prefix</I>/lib/gcc-lib/</CODE> where <I>prefix</I> is the value
of <CODE>prefix</CODE> when you ran the <CODE>configure</CODE> script.
<BR><BR>
Other prefixes specified with <B>'-B'</B> take precedence over this prefix.
<BR><BR>
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <CODE>/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib</CODE>
(more precisely, with the value of <CODE>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</CODE>), GCC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <B>'-B<I>foo</I>/'</B>, GCC will search
<CODE><I>foo</I>/<I>bar</I></CODE> where it would normally search <CODE>/usr/local/lib/<I>bar</I></CODE>.
These alternate directories are searched first; the standard directories
come next.
</P><DT><P><B>COMPILER_PATH</B></P><DD><P>The value of <CODE>COMPILER_PATH</CODE> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>.  GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.
</P><DT><P><B>LIBRARY_PATH</B></P><DD><P>The value of <CODE>LIBRARY_PATH</CODE> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>.  When configured as a native compiler (which GCC4TI is <I>not</I>),
GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using <CODE>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</CODE>.  Linking
using GCC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <B>'-l'</B> option (but directories specified with
<B>'-L'</B> come first).
</P><DT><P><B>LANG</B></P><DD><P>This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for <CODE>LANG</CODE> are recognized:
</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>C-JIS</B></P><DD><P>Recognize JIS characters.
</P><DT><P><B>C-SJIS</B></P><DD><P>Recognize SJIS characters.
</P><DT><P><B>C-EUCJP</B></P><DD><P>Recognize EUCJP characters.</P>
</DL>
<P>
If <CODE>LANG</CODE> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler will use mblen and mbtowc as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.</P>
</DL>
<P>Some additional environments variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.</P>
<DL>

<DT><P><B>CPATH</B>
<BR><B>C_INCLUDE_PATH</B></P><DD><P>Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <CODE>PATH</CODE>, in which to look for header files.
The special character, <CODE>PATH_SEPARATOR</CODE>, is target-dependent and
determined at GCC build time.  For Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>CPATH</CODE> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <B>'-I'</B>, but after any paths given with <B>'-I'</B>
options on the command line.
<BR><BR>
<CODE>C_INCLUDE_PATH</CODE> specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with <B>'-isystem'</B>, but after any
paths given with <B>'-isystem'</B> options on the command line.
<BR><BR>
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
<CODE>CPATH</CODE> is <CODE>:/special/include</CODE>, that has the same
effect as <CODE>-I.&nbsp;-I/special/include</CODE>.
</P><DT><P><B>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</B></P><DD><P>If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
<BR><BR>
The value of <CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
<CODE><I>file</I>&nbsp;<I>target</I></CODE>, in which case the rules are written to
file <I>file</I> using <I>target</I> as the target name.
<BR><BR>
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options <B>'-MM'</B> and <B>'-MF'</B>
(see <A HREF="#SEC11">Options Controlling the Preprocessor</A>),
with an optional <B>'-MT'</B> switch, too.
</P><DT><P><B>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</B></P><DD><P>This variable is the same as <CODE>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</CODE> (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
<B>'-M'</B> rather than <B>'-MM'</B>
(see <A HREF="#SEC11">Options Controlling the Preprocessor</A>).
However, the dependence on the main input file is omitted.</P>
